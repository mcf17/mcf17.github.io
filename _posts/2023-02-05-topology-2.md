## 2.1 Topology generated by family of sets

Topology on a set $X$ is nothing but a family of subsets of $X$ satisfying certain axioms. Therefore, it is natural to generalize [Lemma 6 in [1]](https://mcf17.github.io/topology-1/#lemma-6) to arbitrary collection of subsets of $X$. 

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Definition 1. 
Let $X$ be a set, and $\mathcal S$ be a nonempty collection of subsets of $X$. The smallest topology on $X$ that contains $\mathcal S$; guaranteed to exist by [Lemma 6 in [1]](https://mcf17.github.io/topology-1/#lemma-6), is called the **topology generated by $\mathcal S$**, and denoted $\mathcal O_\mathcal S$. 

Conversely, given a topology $\mathcal O$ on $X$, we say **$\mathcal S$ generates $\mathcal O$** if $\mathcal O = \mathcal O_\mathcal S$. 

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

In short $\mathcal O_\mathcal S = \bigcap \\{ \mathcal O : \mathcal O \text{ is a topology on } X \text{ and } \mathcal S \subseteq \mathcal O \\}$. The expression in RHS can be elaborated as follows:

- According to the [3rd open set axiom](https://mcf17.github.io/topology-1/#definition-1), $\mathcal O_\mathcal S$ must contain all possible finite intersections of sets in $\mathcal S$. In other words, the closure of $\mathcal S$ w.r.t finite set intersection must be contained in $\mathcal O_\mathcal S$;

  $$
  \mathcal S \subseteq \mathrm{cl}_\cap(\mathcal S) = \{ X \} \cup \left\{ \bigcap_{k=1}^{n} S_i :  S_1,...,S_n \in \mathcal S,\ n\geq 1 \right\} \subseteq \mathcal O_\mathcal S
  $$

  Here $X$ is padded because of empty intersection.
  
- According to the [2nd open set axiom](https://mcf17.github.io/topology-1/#definition-1), $\mathcal O_{\mathcal S}$ must contain all possible union of sets in $\mathrm{cl}\_\cap(\mathcal S)$. In other words, the closure of $\mathrm{cl}\_\cap(S)$ w.r.t set union must be contained in $\mathcal O_\mathcal S$;
  
  $$
  \mathrm{cl}_\cap(S) \subseteq \mathrm{cl}_\cup(\mathrm{cl}_\cap(\mathcal S)) = \left\{ \bigcup \mathscr U :  \mathscr U \subseteq \mathrm{cl}_\cap(\mathcal S) \right\} \subseteq \mathcal O_\mathcal S.
  $$

Our final mission is to prove collection $ \mathrm{cl}\_\cup(\mathrm{cl}\_\cap(\mathcal S))$ satisfies open set axioms, thus being a topology on $X$. 

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Proposition 2. 

$\mathcal O_\mathcal S = \mathrm{cl}\_\cup(\mathrm{cl}\_\cap( \mathcal S))$. Construction of $\mathcal O_{\mathcal S}$ is a two step process;
1. Take closure of $\mathcal S$ w.r.t finite set intersection; $\mathrm{cl}\_\cap(\mathcal S)$. 
2. Take closure of $\mathrm{cl}\_\cap(\mathcal S)$ w.r.t set union; $\mathrm{cl}\_\cup(\mathrm{cl}\_\cap(\mathcal S))$. 

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

{% capture notice-1 %}
***Proof of Proposition 2***. 
What's left is to prove $\mathscr S = \mathrm{cl}\_\cup(\mathrm{cl}\_\cap(\mathcal S))$ is a topology on $X$. If that's the case, then the minimality of $\mathcal O_\mathcal S$ implies both are equal. 

1. It is clear that $\mathscr S$ contains $\emptyset$ and $X$.
2. Let $\\{ T_\alpha \\}\_{\alpha \in I}$ be a collection of sets in $\mathscr S$. For each $\alpha \in I$, choose suitable collection of sets $\mathcal U_{\alpha} = \\{ U_a^\alpha \\}\_{a\in I_\alpha} \subseteq \mathrm{cl}\_{\cap}({\mathcal S})$ satisfying $T_\alpha = \bigcup_{a \in I_\alpha} U_a^\alpha$.
   
   $$
    \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} T_\alpha = \bigcup_{(\alpha, a) : \alpha \in I, a \in I_\alpha} U_a^\alpha \in \mathscr S
   $$ 
   proves that $\mathscr S$ satisfies 2nd open set axiom.
3. Given two indices $\alpha, \beta \in I$, 
   
   $$ T_\alpha \cap T_\beta = \bigcup_{a \in I_\alpha} U_a^{\alpha} \cap \bigcup_{b \in I_\beta} U_b^{\beta} = \bigcup_{(a,b) \in I_\alpha \times I_\beta} (U_a^\alpha \cap U_b^\beta)
   $$
   Since $U_a^\alpha \cap U_b^\beta$ is again a finite intersection of sets in $\mathcal S$. Therefore $T_\alpha \cap T_\beta \in \mathscr S$. 

Above shows that $\mathscr S$ is a topology on $X$.

## 2.2 Subbase and base

If one can generate a topology using selected collection of subsets, one can also think about collection of open sets that **generates the given topology** $\mathcal O$. 

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Definition 3. 

Let $(X,\mathcal O)$ be a topological space. A collection of subsets of $X$, $\mathcal S$ is called a **subbase** of $(X,\mathcal O)$ if it generates $\mathcal O$; i.e. $\mathcal O = \mathcal O_\mathcal S$.

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

Automatically, subbase consists of open sets in $X$. Subbase is not unique, in fact there can be several subbases of a given topology (for instance the topology $\mathcal O$ itself). 

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Definition 4. 

Let $(X,\mathcal O)$ be a topological space. A collection of subsets of $X$, $\mathcal B$ is called a **base** of $(X,\mathcal O)$ if every open set in $X$ is a union of sets in $\mathcal  B$.

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

Unlike subbase, bases must generate the topology using only "union" operation. So the first step in **Proposition 2** is omitted. Therefore, 

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Corollary 5. 
Bases are subbases. 

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

What about the converse? In order for subbase to be a base, the first step in **Proposition 2** must be redundant. In other words, the closure under finite intersection must be contained in the closure under union. 

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Proposition 6.
Let $(X,\mathcal O)$ be a topological space, and $\mathcal B$ be a **subbase** of $(X,\mathcal O)$. Then the following are equivalent. 
1. $\mathcal B$ is a base of $(X,\mathcal O)$.
2. - $\bigcup \mathcal B = X$.
   - For every $B_1, B_2 \in \mathcal B$ and $x\in B_1\cap B_2$, there exists $B_3 \in \mathcal B$ such that $x\in B_3 \subseteq B_1 \cap B_2$. 

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

{% capture notice-1 %}
***Proof of Proposition 6***. (1) $\implies$ (2) is evident. For the converse, note that (2) is a restatement of $\mathrm{cl}\_{\cap}(\mathcal B) \subseteq \mathrm{cl}\_{\cup}(\mathcal B)$. If that is the case, 

$$
\mathcal O = \mathrm{cl}_\cup(\mathrm{cl}_{\cap}(\mathcal B)) \subseteq \mathrm{cl}_{\cup}(\mathrm{cl}_{\cup}(\mathcal B)) = \mathrm{cl}_{\cup}(\mathcal B) \subseteq \mathcal O,
$$

proving $\mathcal O = \mathrm{cl}\_{\cup}(\mathcal B)$. 

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

## 2.3 Neighborhood and nearness

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Definition 7

Let $(X,\mathcal O)$ be a topological space. A subset $N$ of $X$ is said to be a **neighborhood** of $x\in X$ in $(X,\mathcal O)$ if there exists an open set $U$ in $X$ satisfying $x\in U \subseteq N \subseteq X$. 

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

Intuitively, $N$ is a neighborhood of $x$ if locally, $x$ can not escape from $N$. 

- In most cases, we omit the underlying topological space $(X,\mathcal O)$ and just say $N$ is a neighborhood of $x$. 
- Every open set containing $x$ is a neighborhood of $x$, but not all neighborhoods of $x$ are open. Neighborhoods of $x$ that are open are called **open neighborhoods**.
- We use notations $\mathcal N(x)$ to denote the collection of all neighborhoods of $x$, and $\mathcal U(x)$ to denote the the collection of all **open** neighborhoods of $x$. 

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Proposition 8. 
Let $U$ be a nonempty subset of a topological space $(X,\mathcal O)$. Then the following are equivalent:
1. $U$ is open in $X$.
2. $U$ is a neighborhood of every point of it.
   
{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

{% capture notice-1 %}
***Proof of Proposition 8***. (1) $\implies$ (2) Evident. 

(2) $\implies$ (1) For each $x\in U$, choose an open set $V_x$ satisfying $x\in V_x\subseteq U$. Then $U  = \bigcup_{x\in U} V_x$ is open.

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

Using neighborhoods, one can define "**topological nearness**" between a point and a subset of $X$.

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Definition 9. 
Let $(X,\mathcal O)$ be a topological space, $x\in X$, $A \subseteq X$. We say $x$ is near to $A$ (or simply denote $x\delta A$) if every neighborhood of $x$ in $(X,\mathcal O)$ intersects with $A$; $N\cap A \neq \emptyset$ for every $N\in\mathcal N(x)$.

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

Note that **Definition 9** requires all neighborhoods of $x$ must intersect with $A$. Since every neighborhood of $x$ contains an open neighborhood of $x$, it suffices to apply **Definition 9** only to open neighborhoods of $x$.

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Proposition 10. 
Let $(X,\mathcal O)$ be a topological space, $x,y \in X$ and $A,B \subseteq X$. Then the following holds:
1. $\lnot (x\delta \emptyset)$; emptyset is far from any point in $X$.
2. $x\in  A \implies x\delta A$; any set is near to points belong to it.
3. $x\delta (A\cup B) \implies x \delta A \text{ or } x \delta B$; 
4. $x \delta A$ and $y \delta B$ for all $y \in A \implies x \delta B$; if $x$ is near to $A$ and every point of $A$ is near to $B$, then $x$ is near to $B$. 

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

{% capture notice-1 %}
***Proof of Proposition 10***.  1 and 2 are evident.

- For 3 we use proof by contradiction. Suppose $x$ is not near to both $A$ and $B$. Choose suitable neighborhoods $N$ and $M$ of $x4 such that $N\cap A = M \cap B = \emptyset$. While $M\cap N$ is a neighborhood of $x$, it satisfies

   $$
   (M\cap N)\cap (A \cup B) = [(M\cap N)\cap A] \cup [(M\cap N)\cap B] \subseteq (N\cap A)   \cup (M\cap B) = \emptyset.
   $$

   This is contradiction. Therefore, $x$ must be near to at least one of $A$ or $B$. 
- For 4, we first choose a neighborhood $N$ of $x$ and an open set $U$ contained in it; $x \in U \subseteq N$. Since $U\cap Y \neq \emptyset$, choose a point $y \in U \cap Y$. By **Proposition 8**, $U$ is an open neighborhood of $y$. Therefore $U\cap B \neq \emptyset$, $U\cap B \subseteq N \cap B$ proves  $N\cap B \neq \emptyset$ as well. In short $x$ is near to $B$.
  
{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

In short, if we can consist subbase and base  with sets that are easier to think about than general open sets, they enable us to describe topology in a clear and concise way. 

## 2.4 Local base

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Proposition 11. 
The collection of all neighborhoods of $x$, $\mathcal N(x)$ satisfies the following:
1. $\mathcal N(x)$ is nonempty, and $\emptyset \notin \mathcal N(x)$.
2. If $N,M \in \mathcal N(x)$, then $N\cap M \in \mathcal N(x)$. 
3. If $N\in\mathcal N(x)$ and $N \subseteq M$, then $M \in \mathcal N(x)$. 

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

From property 3 in **Proposition 11**, we can see that $\mathcal N(x)$ is a massive collection of subsets of $X$. Similar to  base of a topology, one can use strictly smaller amount of neighborhoods of $x$ to describe $\mathcal N(x)$. 

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Definition 12.
Let $(X,\mathcal O)$ be a topological space, and $x\in X$. A **local base** of $x$ in $(X,\mathcal)$ is a collection of neighborhoods of $x$ in $(X,\mathcal O)$, $\mathcal B(x)$, such that for every neighborhood $N$ of $x$, there exists $B\in \mathcal B(x)$ such that $x \in B \subseteq N$. 

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

Now property 3 in **Proposition 12** can be safely ignored, if we have a local base in hand. 

Local bases are not unique. In fact, an obvious local base of $x$ is $\mathcal U(x)$, the collection of all open neighborhoods of $x$. Additionally, **restriction on global bases produce local bases**. 

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Proposition 13. 
The following holds: 
1. All points in $(X,\mathcal O)$ admits $\mathcal U(x)$ as a local base.
2. If $\mathcal B$ is a base of $(X,\mathcal O)$, then $\mathcal B(x) = \\{B \in \mathcal B:  x\in B\\}$ is a local base of $x$.

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

{% capture notice-1 %}
***Proof of Proposition 13***. 

1. Evident from the definition.
2. Evident from **Proposition 6**.
