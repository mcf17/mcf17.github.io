Several topological concepts are defined by tagging additional information to subsets. 

## Closed set and closure

Let $A$ be a subset of a topological space $(X,\mathcal O)$. [Definition 9 in [3]](https://mcf17.github.io/topology/topology-2/#definition-9) motivates us to define a set of points in $X$ that is near to $A$. 

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Definition 1.

Let $A$ be a subset of a topological space $(X,\mathcal O)$. The collection of all points in $X$ that is near to $A$ is called the **closure** of $A$ in $(X,\mathcal O)$, and is denoted as $\mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$. 

$$
\mathrm{cl}_X(A) = \{ x\in X : x \delta A \}.
$$

{% endcapture %}

In fact, $\mathrm{cl}\_X(\cdot)$ serves as a **closure operator** on $\mathcal P(X)$.  [Proposition 10 in [3]](https://mcf17.github.io/topology/topology-2/#proposition-10) can be restated in terms of closure operator $\mathrm{cl}\_X(\cdot)$. 

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Proposition 2.
Given any subset $A$ of a topological space $X$, the following holds:
1. $\mathrm{cl}\_ X(\emptyset) = \emptyset$.
2. $A \subseteq \mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$.
3. $\mathrm{cl}\_X(A\cup B) = \mathrm{cl}\_X(A) \cup \mathrm{cl}\_X(B)$.
4. $\mathrm{cl}\_X(\mathrm{cl}\_X(A)) = \mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$. 
   
{% endcapture %}

{% capture notice-1 %}
**Proof of Proposition 2**. 1, 2, and 3 are evident from [**Proposition 10 in [3]**](https://mcf17.github.io/topology/topology-2/#proposition-10). For item 4, choose $x \in \mathrm{cl}\_X(\mathrm{cl}\_X(A))$, i.e. $x \delta \mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$. For every $y\in \mathrm{cl}\_ X(A)$,  $y \delta A$ by definition. Therefore, $x \delta A$ as well, using [**Proposition 10 in [3]**](https://mcf17.github.io/topology/topology-2/#proposition-10). 

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>


Property 4 listed in **Proposition 2** is extremely important. Why? Because, it shows that the closure operator is **idempotent**, and we can not add points to $\mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$ using iterative application of "nearness" condition. 

Suppose $x$ is a point **not** in $\mathrm{cl}\_X(A) = \mathrm{cl}\_X(\mathrm{cl}\_X(A))$. Then $x$ is not near to $A$, **nor** to $\mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$. Therefore, there exists a neighborhood $N$ of $x$ that is contained in $A$, as well as $\mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$. Since $x$ was arbitrary, [Proposition 8 in [2]](https://mcf17.github.io/topology/topology-2/#proposition-8) proves that $X\setminus \mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$ is open in $X$. 

Above discussion motivates us to define a new concept; **closedness**.

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Definition 3.

A subset $A$ of a topological space $X$ is **closed** if $X\setminus A$ is open in $X$. 
   
{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

Intuitively, closed sets can be thought of as a village of points, and any point outside the village can not reach near to it. 

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Proposition 4.

For any subset $A$ of a topological space $X$, the following holds:

1. $\mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$ is closed in $X$.
2. $A$ is closed in $X$ if and only if $A = \mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$. 
   
{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

{% capture notice-1 %}
**Proof of Proposition 4**. 
1. Evident from **Definition 3**.
2. $(\implies)$ Our goal is to prove $\mathrm{cl}\_X(A) \subseteq A$. Suppose not, and we can choose $x \in \mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$ but $x \notin A$. Since $A$ is closed, one can choose a neighborhood $N$ of $x$ that is contained in $X\setminus A$. This directly contradicts to the fact that $x \in \mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$. Hence such $x$ does not exist, and $A = \mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$. 

   $(\impliedby)$ is evident. 

{% endcapture %}

Since closed sets are complements of open sets, one can utilize DeMorgan's law and characterize closed sets resembling open set axioms.

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Proposition 5.
Let $X$ be a topological space. The following holds:

1. $\emptyset, X$ is closed in $X$.
2. If $\mathscr C$ is a collection of closed sets, then $\bigcap \mathscr C$ is closed in $X$.
3. If $C, D$ are closed sets, then $C \cup D$ is closed in $X$.

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

Consider any **closed** set $C$ containing a subset $A$ of $X$. Since $C$ is closed, $C = \mathrm{cl}\_X(C)$. Using **Proposition 2**-(3), 

$$
C = \mathrm{cl}_X(C) = \mathrm{cl}_X(A\cup C) = \mathrm{cl}_X(A) \cup \mathrm{cl}_X(C) \implies \mathrm{cl}_X(A) \subseteq C.
$$

Therefore, 

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Proposition 6.

$\mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$ is the **smallest** closed set in $X$ that contains $A$. Resorting to **Proposition 5**,

$$
\mathrm{cl}_X(A) = \bigcap \left\{ C \subseteq X : C \text{ is closed in } X \text{ and } A \subseteq C \right\}.
$$

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

## Interior and boundary

Unlike closed sets, open sets are not closed under "arbitrary" intersection. Rather it is closed under union. Therefore, we can talk about the **largest** open set in $X$ that is contained in a particular subset $A$. 

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Definition 7.
Let $X$ be a topological space and $A \subseteq X$. The largest open set in $X$ that is contained in $A$ is called a **interior** of $A$ in $X$, and is denoted $\mathrm{int}\_X(A)$. Formally,

$$
\mathrm{int}_X(A) = \bigcup \left\{ U \subseteq X : U \text{ is open in } X \text{ and } U \subseteq A \right\}.
$$

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

Intuitively, interior of $A$ consists of points having $A$ as their neighborhoods. Similar to **Proposition 2**, several properties of $\mathrm{int}\_X(A)$ is listed.

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Proposition 8.
Let $X$ be a topological space. Then the following holds:

1. $\mathrm{int}\_X(\emptyset) = \emptyset$.
2. $\mathrm{int}\_X(A) \subseteq A$.
3. $\mathrm{int}\_X(A\cap B) = \mathrm{int}\_X(A) \cap \mathrm{int}\_X(B)$.
4. $\mathrm{int}\_X(\mathrm{int}\_X(A)) = \mathrm{int}\_X(A)$.
5. $\mathrm{int}\_X(A)$ is open in $X$ for every subset $A$ of $X$.
6. $A$ is open in $X$ if and only if $\mathrm{int}\_X(A) = A$. 

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>


For any subset $A$ of $X$, $X\setminus \mathrm{int}_X(A)$ is a closed in $X$ that contains $X\setminus A$. Minimality of closure implies

$$
X\setminus \mathrm{int}_X(A) \supseteq \mathrm{cl}_X(X\setminus A). 
$$

What about the converse? $X \setminus \mathrm{int}\_X(A)$ consists of points that do **not**  have $A$ as their neighborhoods. Therefore, every open neighborhood of points in $X\setminus \mathrm{int}\_X(A)$ **must** intersect with $X\setminus A$ (try to think about the negation of the $U \subseteq A$). Precisely by definition, points in $X\setminus \mathrm{int}\_X(A)$ must belong to closure of $X\setminus A$. 

In short,

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Theorem 9.
For any subset $A$ of a topological space $X$, 

$$
\mathrm{int}_X(A) = X \setminus \mathrm{cl}_X(X\setminus A).
$$

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

{% capture notice-1 %}
**Proof of Theorem 9**. Here I give a direct proof. 

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{int}_X(A) 
&= \bigcup \left\{ U \subseteq X : U \text{ is open in } X \text{ and } U \subseteq A \right\} \\
&= \bigcup \left\{ X\setminus C \subseteq X : C \text{ is closed in } X \text{ and } X\setminus C \subseteq A \right\} \\
&= \bigcup \left\{ X\setminus C \subseteq X : C \text{ is closed in } X \text{ and } C \supseteq X\setminus A \right\} \\
&= X\setminus \bigcap \left\{ C \subseteq X : C \text{ is closed in } X \text{ and } C \supseteq X\setminus A \right\} \\
&= X\setminus \mathrm{cl}_X(X\setminus A).

\end{align*}
$$

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

Intuitively, points in $\mathrm{int}\_X(A)$ are the ones that can not escape from $A$ by local movements. On the other hand, points in $\mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$ are the ones that are near to $A$. Since $\mathrm{int}\_X(A) \subseteq A \subseteq \mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$, what can be said about points in 

$$
\mathrm{cl}_X(A) \setminus \mathrm{int}_X(A)?
$$

Such points are near to $A$, but can freely escape from $A$ at any time. 

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Definition 10.
For any subset $A$ of a topological space $X$ the **boundary** of $A$ in $X$ is defined by

$$
\partial_X(A) = \mathrm{cl}_X(A) \setminus \mathrm{int}_X(A).
$$

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Proposition 11.
For any subset $A$ of a topological space $X$, 

1. $\partial_X(A) = \mathrm{cl}\_X(A) \cap \mathrm{cl}\_X(X\setminus A)$.
2. $\partial_X(A) = \partial_X(X\setminus A)$.
3. $\partial_X(A)$ is closed in $X$.
4. $X = \mathrm{int}\_X(A) \sqcup \partial_X(A) \sqcup \mathrm{int}\_X(X\setminus A)$ (so three sets **partition** $X$). 

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

{% capture notice-1 %}

**Proof of Proposition 11**. 
1. $\partial_X(A) = \mathrm{cl}\_X(A) \setminus \mathrm{int}\_X(A) = \mathrm{cl}\_X(A) \cap (X\setminus \mathrm{int}\_X(A)) = \mathrm{cl}\_X(A) \cap \mathrm{cl}\_X(X\setminus A)$.
2. Evident from (1).
3. Evident from (1).
4. By **Theorem 9**, $X = \mathrm{int}\_X(A) \sqcup \mathrm{cl}\_X(X\setminus A) = \mathrm{int}\_X(A) \sqcup \partial_X(X\setminus A) \sqcup \mathrm{int}\_X(X\setminus A)$.
   By (2), replacing $\partial_X(X\setminus A)$ by $\partial_X(A)$ completes the proof.

{% endcapture %}

One interesting fact about the boundary operator is that it is **weakly idempotent**. Since $\partial_X(A)$ is closed, 
   
$$
\begin{align*}
\partial_X \partial_X (A) 
&= \mathrm{cl}_X(\partial_X(A)) \setminus \mathrm{int}_X(\partial_X(A)) \\
&= \partial_X(A) \setminus \mathrm{int}_X(\partial_X(A)) \\
&\subseteq \partial_X(A).
\end{align*}
$$

For the converse, the following counterexample shows that it is not true in general:

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Counter Example 12. 

Consider $\mathbb{N}$ equipped with the cofinite topology $\mathcal O_{cofin}$. For $P$ the set of primes, 
- $\mathrm{int}\_\mathbb{N}(P) = \emptyset$, because $\mathbb{N}\setminus P$ is not finite. 
- $\mathrm{cl}\_\mathbb{N}(P) = \mathbb{N}$, because any nonempty open set in $\mathbb{N}$ intersects with $P$ (why?)

Thus $\partial_\mathbb{N}(P) = \mathbb{N}$. But $\partial_\mathbb{N}(\partial_\mathbb{N}(P)) = \partial_\mathbb{N}(\mathbb{N}) = \mathbb{N} \setminus \mathbb{N} = \emptyset $.  

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

What's true in general is the following:

$$
\partial_X\partial_X(A) = \partial_X\partial_X\partial_X(A).
$$

 This is because $\mathrm{int}\_X(\partial_X\partial_X(A)) = \emptyset$. To see this, if $x$ is an interior point of $\partial_X\partial_X(A)$, then one must have an open set $U$ satisfying

$$
x \in U \subseteq \partial_X \partial_X(A) \subseteq \partial_X(A).
$$

This is impossible since being a point in $\partial_X\partial_X(A)$ implies every neighborhood of $x$ must intersect with $\partial_X(A)$ as well as $X\setminus \partial_X(A)$ (property 2 in **Proposition 11**).
