Several topological concepts are defined by tagging additional information to subsets. 

## Closed set and closure

Let $A$ be a subset of a topological space $(X,\mathcal O)$. [Definition 9 in [3]](https://mcf17.github.io/topology/topology-2/#definition-9) motivates us to define a set of points in $X$ that is near to $A$. 

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Definition 1.

Let $A$ be a subset of a topological space $(X,\mathcal O)$. The collection of all points in $X$ that is near to $A$ is called the **closure** of $A$ in $(X,\mathcal O)$, and is denoted as $\mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$. 

$$
\mathrm{cl}_X(A) = \{ x\in X : x \delta A \}.
$$

In fact, $\mathrm{cl}\_X(\cdot)$ serves as a **closure operator** on $\mathcal P(X)$.  [Proposition 10 in [3]](https://mcf17.github.io/topology/topology-2/#proposition-10) can be restated in terms of closure operator $\mathrm{cl}\_X(\cdot)$. 

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Proposition 2.
Given any subset $A$ of a topological space $X$, the following holds:
1. $\mathrm{cl}\_ X(\emptyset) = \emptyset$.
2. $A \subseteq \mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$.
3. $\mathrm{cl}\_X(A\cup B) = \mathrm{cl}\_X(A) \cup \mathrm{cl}\_X(B)$.
4. $\mathrm{cl}\_X(\mathrm{cl}\_X(A)) = \mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$.

**Proof of Proposition 2**. 1, 2, and 3 are evident from [Proposition 10 in [3]](https://mcf17.github.io/topology/topology-2/#proposition-10). For item 4, choose $x \in \mathrm{cl}\_X(\mathrm{cl}\_X(A))$, i.e. $x \delta \mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$. For every $y\in \mathrm{cl}\_ X(A)$,  $y \delta A$ by definition. Therefore, $x \delta A$ as well, using [Proposition 10 in [3]](https://mcf17.github.io/topology/topology-2/#proposition-10).

Property 4 listed in **Proposition 2** is extremely important. Why? Because, it shows that the closure operator is idempotent, and we can not add points to $\mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$ using iterative application of "nearness" condition. Suppose $x$ is a point **not** in $\mathrm{cl}\_X(A) = \mathrm{cl}\_X(\mathrm{cl}\_X(A))$. Then $x$ is not near to $A$, **nor** to $\mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$. Therefore, there exists a neighborhood $N$ of $x$ that is contained in $A$, as well as $\mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$. Since $x$ was arbitrary, [Proposition 8 in [2]](https://mcf17.github.io/topology/topology-2/#proposition-8) proves that $X\setminus \mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$ is open in $X$. 

Above discussion motivates us to define a newer concept; called **closedness**.

### Definition 3.

A subset $A$ of a topological space $X$ is **closed** if $X\setminus A$ is open in $X$. 
   
{% endcapture %}

Intuitively, closed sets can be thought of as a village of points, and any point outside the village can not reach near to it. 

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Proposition 4.

For any subset $A$ of a topological space $X$, the following holds:

1. $\mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$ is closed in $X$.
2. $A$ is closed in $X$ if and only if $A = \mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$. 
   
{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

{% capture notice-1 %}
**Proof of Proposition 4**. 
1. Evident from **Definition 3**.
2. $(\implies)$ Our goal is to prove $\mathrm{cl}\_X(A) \subseteq A$. Suppose not, and we can choose $x \in \mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$ but $x \notin A$. Since $A$ is closed, one can choose a neighborhood $N$ of $x$ that is contained in $X\setminus A$. This directly contradicts to the fact that $x \in \mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$. Hence such $x$ does not exist, and $A = \mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$. 

   $(\impliedby)$ is evident.

Since closed sets are complements of open sets, one can utilize DeMorgan's law and characterize closed sets resembling open set axioms.

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Proposition 5.
Let $X$ be a topological space. The following holds:

1. $\emptyset, X$ is closed in $X$.
2. If $\mathscr C$ is a collection of closed sets, then $\bigcap \mathscr C$ is closed in $X$.
3. If $C, D$ are closed sets, then $C \cup D$ is closed in $X$.

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

Consider any **closed** set $C$ containing a subset $A$ of $X$. Since $C$ is closed, $C = \mathrm{cl}\_X(C)$. Using **Proposition 2**-(3), 

$$
C = \mathrm{cl}_X(C) = \mathrm{cl}_X(A\cup C) = \mathrm{cl}_X(A) \cup \mathrm{cl}_X(C) \implies \mathrm{cl}_X(A) \subseteq C.
$$

Therefore,

### Proposition 6.

$\mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$ is the **smallest** closed set in $X$ that contains $A$.
