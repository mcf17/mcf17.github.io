Here we continue discussion about tagging information to subsets.

## Accumulation points and derived sets

Closure of a subset $A$ consists of points near to $A$. What if such points do not belong to $A$? What can be said about points in $\mathrm{cl}\_X(A) \setminus A$?

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Definition 1.

Let $X$ be a topological space and $A$ be a subset of $X$. A point $x\in X$ is called an **accumulation point** of $A$ if every neighborhood of $x$ in $X$ intersects with $A$ **that is different from $x$**. Collection of all accumulation points of $A$ is denoted $A_X^d$, and is called the **derived set** of $A$ in $X$.

### Corollary 2.

$\mathrm{cl}\_X(A) = A \cup A_X^d$.

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

{% capture notice-1 %}
**Proof of Proposition 2**. 

**Definition 1** shows $A_X^d \subseteq \mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$. If $x \in \mathrm{cl}\_X(A)\setminus A$, then every neighborhood of $x$ must intersect with $A$ different from $x$, because already $x \notin A$. 

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

We can further generalize the concept of an accumulation point and derived set based on the cardinality of intersection.

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Definition 3.

Let $X$ be a topological space and $A$ be a subset of $X$. A point $x\in X$ is called an 
- **$\omega$-accumulation point** of $A$ in $X$ if $N\cap A$ is **countably infinite** for every neighborhood of $x$.
- **condensation point** of $A$ in $X$ if $N\cap A$ is **uncountable** for every neighborhood of $x$.

The set of all $\omega$-accumulation (resp. condensation) point of $A$ in $X$ is denoted $A_X^{\omega}$ (resp. $A_X^{cd}$).

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

It is clear that $A^{cd} \subseteq A^\omega \subseteq A^d \subseteq \mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$. 

## Dense subsets and perfect subsets

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Definition 4.

A subset $A$ of a topological space $X$ is said to be 
1. **dense** in $X$ if $\mathrm{cl}\_X(A) = X$.
2. **nowhere dense** in $X$ if $\mathrm{int}\_X(\mathrm{cl}\_X(A)) = \emptyset$.
3. **dense in itself** if $A \subseteq A_X^d$. 

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

Intuitively, 
- a set is dense if every point in $X$ is near to it. 
- a set is nowhere dense if the closure $\mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$  is not tightly clustered. 
- a set is dense in itself if no points in $A$ are isolated from others. (no islands). 

There can be several dense subsets in a topological space (other than $X$ itself). 

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Proposition 4.

If $U$ is open in $X$ and $A$ is a subset of $X$, then 

$$
\mathrm{cl}_X(U \cap \mathrm{cl}_X(A)) = \mathrm{cl}_X(U\cap A).
$$

In particular, if $A$ is dense in $X$, then $\mathrm{cl}\_X(U) = \mathrm{cl}\_X(U\cap A)$.

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

{% capture notice-1 %}
**Proof of Proposition 4**. We only have to prove $\implies$ part. Suppose $x$ is near to $U\cap \mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$. Then every open neighborhood $V$ of $x$ intersects with $U\cap \mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$, i.e., $U\cap V \not\subseteq X\setminus \mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$. Applying [Proposition 7 in [3]]() to $U\cap V$, we obtain $U\cap V \cap A \neq \emptyset$. Since $V$ was arbitrary, $x$ is near to $U\cap A$ as well.
