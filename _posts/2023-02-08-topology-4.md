Here we continue our discussion about tagging information to subsets.

## Accumulation points and derived sets

Closure of a subset $A$ consists of points near to $A$. What if such points do not belong to $A$? What can be said about points in $\mathrm{cl}\_X(A) \setminus A$?

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Definition 1.

Let $X$ be a topological space and $A$ be a subset of $X$. A point $x\in X$ is called an **accumulation point** of $A$ if every neighborhood of $x$ in $X$ intersects with $A$ **that is different from $x$**. Collection of all accumulation points of $A$ is denoted $A_X^d$, and is called the **derived set** of $A$ in $X$.

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Corollary 2.

$\mathrm{cl}\_X(A) = A \cup A_X^d$.

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

{% capture notice-1 %}
**Proof of Proposition 2**. 
**Definition 1** shows $A_X^d \subseteq \mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$. If $x \in \mathrm{cl}\_X(A)\setminus A$, then every neighborhood of $x$ must intersect with $A$ different from $x$, because already $x \notin A$. 

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

We can further generalize the concept of an accumulation point and derived set based on the cardinality of intersection.

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Definition 3.

Let $X$ be a topological space and $A$ be a subset of $X$. A point $x\in X$ is called an 
- **$\omega$-accumulation point** of $A$ in $X$ if $N\cap A$ is **countably infinite** for every neighborhood of $x$.
- **condensation point** of $A$ in $X$ if $N\cap A$ is **uncountable** for every neighborhood of $x$.

The set of all $\omega$-accumulation (resp. condensation) point of $A$ in $X$ is denoted $A_X^{\omega}$ (resp. $A_X^{cd}$).

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

It is clear that $A^{cd} \subseteq A^\omega \subseteq A^d \subseteq \mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$. 

## Dense subsets and perfect subsets

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Definition 4.

A subset $A$ of a topological space $X$ is said to be 
1. **dense** in $X$ if $\mathrm{cl}\_X(A) = X$.
2. **nowhere dense** in $X$ if $\mathrm{int}\_X(\mathrm{cl}\_X(A)) = \emptyset$.
3. **dense in itself** if $A \subseteq A_X^d$. 

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

Intuitively, 
- a set is dense if every point in $X$ is near to it. 
- a set is nowhere dense if the closure $\mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$  is not tightly clustered. 
- a set is dense in itself if no points in $A$ are isolated from others. (no islands). 

Considering dense in itself subsets, an extreme case would be a topological space that does not admit any dense in itself subsets. In other words, every subset has an isolated point (we say a point in a topological space is **isolated** if the singleton is open in that topology). 

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Definition 5.

A topological space $(X,\mathcal O)$ is said to be **scattered** if every subset of $X$ is **not** dense in itself.

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Proposition 6.

If $U$ is open in $X$ and $A$ is a subset of $X$, then 

$$
\mathrm{cl}_X(U \cap \mathrm{cl}_X(A)) = \mathrm{cl}_X(U\cap A).
$$

In particular, if $A$ is dense in $X$, then $\mathrm{cl}\_X(U) = \mathrm{cl}\_X(U\cap A)$.

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

{% capture notice-1 %}
**Proof of Proposition 5**. We only need to prove $\implies$ part. Suppose $x$ is near to $U\cap \mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$. Then every open neighborhood $V$ of $x$ intersects with $U\cap \mathrm{cl}\_X(A)$, i.e., $(U\cap V) \cap \mathrm{cl}\_X(A) \neq \emptyset$. Applying [Proposition 7 in [3]](https://mcf17.github.io/topology/topology-3/#proposition-7) to $U\cap V$, we obtain $U\cap V \cap A \neq \emptyset$. Since $V$ was arbitrary, $x$ is near to $U\cap A$ as well.


If $A$ is dense in $X$, then plugging in  $\mathrm{cl}\_X(A) = X$ gives the desired result.
{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

A set is closed if $A^d \subseteq A$, and dense in itself if $A \subseteq A^d$. Combining both gives the following definition.

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Definition 7.

A subset $A$ of a topological space $X$ is **perfect** in $X$ if $A = A_X^d$. 

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

Intuitively, every point in a perfect set can be well **approximated** (in a topological sense using the nearness condition) by **other points in that set**. 

## $G_\delta$ and $F_\sigma$ sets

Finite intersection of open sets is open, and finite union of closed sets is closed. What about countable intersection of open sets, or countable union of open sets?

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Definition 8.

We say a subset $A$ of a topological space $X$ is 
- $G_\delta$ set if $A$ is a countable intersection of open sets in $X$, and
- $F_\sigma$ set if $A$ is a countable union of closed sets in $X$.

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Observation 9.

Set complement of $G_\delta$ set is a $F_\sigma$ set, and vice versa.

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

$G_\delta$ sets need not be open, and $F_\sigma$ sets need not be closed. 

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Example 10.

Consider a cocountable topology on an uncountable set $X$. Given a countably infinite subset $A = \\{ a_n \\}$ of $X$, $A = \bigcup_n \\{ a_n\\}$ is a $F_\sigma$ set, but not closed in $X$. 

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

Albeit one can define a space having the following property:

{% capture notice-1 %}
### Definition 11.

A **$G_\delta$ space** is a topological space in which every closed set is a $G_\delta$ set (equivalently, every open set is a $F_\sigma$ set). 

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

$G_\delta$ space is crucial when characterizing perfectly normal spaces.
